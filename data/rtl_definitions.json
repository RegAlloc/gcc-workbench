In the  \nexpansion for a particular modei, every C condition will also require that condi  \nbe true.  \nFor example:  \n(define_mode_iterator P [(SI \"Pmode == SImode\") (DI \"Pmode == DImode\")])  \ndefines a new mode suffix :P. Every construct that uses :P will be  \nexpanded twice, once with every :P replaced by :SI and once with every :P  \nreplaced by :DI. The :SI version will only apply if Pmode == SImode and the :DI  \nversion will only apply if Pmode == DImode. As with other .md conditions, an  \nempty string is treated as “always true”. (mode \"\") can also be abbreviated to  \nmode. For example: (define_mode_iterator GPR [SI (DI \"TARGET_64BIT\")]) means  \nthat the :DI expansion only applies if TARGET_64BIT but that the :SI expansion  \nhas no such constraint.  \n  \nIt is also possible to include iterators in other iterators. For example:  \n  \n(define_mode_iterator VI [V16QI V8HI V4SI V2DI])  \n(define_mode_iterator VF [V8HF V4SF (V2DF \"TARGET_DOUBLE\")])  \n(define_mode_iterator V [VI (VF \"TARGET_FLOAT\")])  \n  \nmakes ‘:V’ iterate over the modes in VI and the modes in VF. When a construct  \nuses ‘:V’, the V8HF and V4SF expansions require ‘TARGET_FLOAT’ while the V2DF  \nexpansion requires ‘TARGET_DOUBLE && TARGET_FLOAT’.

  "define_mode_attr": "If an .md file construct uses mode iterators, each version of the construct will often need  \nlightly different strings or modes.

There are two  \nstandard attributes: mode, which is the name of the mode in lower case, and MODE, which  \nis the same thing in upper case. You can define other attributes using:  \n(define_mode_attr name [(mode1 \"value1\") ... (moden \"valuen\")])  \nwhere name is the name of the attribute and valuei is the value associated with modei.  \nWhen GCC replaces some :iterator with :mode, it will scan each string and mode in the  \npattern for sequences of the form <iterator:attr>, where attr is the name of a mode attribute. If the attribute is defined for mode, the whole <...> sequence will be replaced  \nby the appropriate attribute value.  \n  \nFor example, suppose an .md file has:  \n(define_mode_iterator P [(SI \"Pmode == SImode\") (DI \"Pmode == DImode\")])  \n(define_mode_attr load [(SI \"lw\") (DI \"ld\")])  \n  \nIf one of the patterns that uses :P contains the string \"<P:load>\\t%0,%1\", the SI version  \nof that pattern will use \"lw\\t%0,%1\" and the DI version will use \"ld\\t%0,%1\".  \nHere is an example of using an attribute for a mode:  \n(define_mode_iterator LONG [SI DI])  \n(define_mode_attr SHORT [(SI \"HI\") (DI \"SI\")])  \n(define_insn ...  \n(sign_extend:LONG (match_operand:<LONG:SHORT> ...)) ...)  \n  \nThe iterator: prefix may be omitted, in which case the substitution will be attempted  \nfor every iterator expansion.",

(coden \"condn\")])  \n  \ndefines a pseudo rtx code name that can be instantiated as codei if condition condi is  \ntrue. Each codei must have the same rtx format. See Section 13.2 [RTL Classes], page 282.  \nAs with mode iterators, each pattern that uses name will be expanded n times, once with  \nall uses of name replaced by code1, once with all uses replaced by code2, and so on.  \nIt is possible to define attributes for codes as well as for modes. There are two standard  \ncode attributes: code, the name of the code in lower case, and CODE, the name of the code  \nin upper case. Other attributes are defined using:  \n(define_code_attr name [(code1 \"value1\") ... (coden \"valuen\")])  \n  \nInstruction patterns can use code attributes as rtx codes, which can be useful if two  \nsets of codes act in tandem. For example, the following define_insn defines two patterns,  \none calculating a signed absolute difference and another calculating an unsigned absolute  \ndifference:  \n(define_code_iterator any_max [smax umax])  \n  \n(define_code_attr paired_min [(smax \"smin\") (umax \"umin\")])  \n  \n(define_insn ...  \n[(set (match_operand:SI 0 ...)  \n(minus:SI (any_max:SI (match_operand:SI 1 ...)  \n(match_operand:SI 2 ...))  \n(<paired_min>:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2))))]  \n...)  \n  \nThe signed version of the instruction uses smax and smin while the unsigned version uses  \numax and umin. There are no versions that pair smax with umin or umax with smin.  \nIt is also possible to use other types of attributes as codes, in a similar way. For example,  \nan int iterator could be used to iterate over unspecnumbers, with an int attribute specifying  \nan associated rtx code.  \nHere’s an example of code iterators in action, taken from the MIPS port:  \n(define_code_iterator any_cond [unordered ordered unlt unge uneq ltgt unle ungt  \nq ne gt ge lt le gtu geu ltu leu])  \n  \n(define_expand \"b<code>\"  \n[(set (pc)  \n(if_then_else (any_cond:CC (cc0)  \n(const_int 0))  \n(label_ref (match_operand 0 \"\"))  \n(pc)))]  \n\"\"  \n{  \ngen_conditional_branch (operands, <CODE>);  \nDONE;  \n})  \n  \nThis is equivalent to:  \n(define_expand \"bunordered\"  \n[(set (pc)  \n(if_then_else (unordered:CC (cc0)  \n(const_int 0))  \n(label_ref (match_operand 0 \"\"))  \n(pc)))]  \n\"\"  \n{  \ngen_conditional_branch (operands, UNORDERED);  \nDONE;  \n})  \n  \n(define_expand \"bordered\"  \n[(set (pc)  \n(if_then_else (ordered:CC (cc0)  \n(const_int 0))  \n(label_ref (match_operand 0 \"\"))  \n(pc)))]  \n\"\"  \n{  \ngen_conditional_branch (operands, ORDERED);  \nDONE;  \n})",

  "define_int_iterator": "Int iterators operate in a similar way to code iterators.  \nThe construct:  \n(define_int_iterator name [(int1 \"cond1\") ... (intn \"condn\")])  \ndefines a pseudo integer constant name that can be instantiated as inti if condition condi  \nis true. Int iterators can appear in only those rtx fields that have ‘i’, ‘n’, ‘w’, or ‘p’ as the  \nspecifier. This means that each int has to be a constant defined using ‘define_constant’  \nor ‘define_c_enum’.  \nAs with mode and code iterators, each pattern that uses name will be expanded n times,  \nonce with all uses of name replaced by int1, once with all uses replaced by int2, and so on.  \nSee Section 16.24.1.1 [Defining Mode Iterators], page 518.  \nIt is possible to define attributes for ints as well as for codes and modes. Attributes are  \ndefined using:  \n(define_int_attr attr_name [(int1 \"value1\") ... (intn \"valuen\")])  \nIn additon to these user-defined attributes, it is possible to use ‘<name>’ to refer to the  \ncurrent expansion of iterator name (such as int1, int2, and so on).  \nHere’s an example of int iterators in action, taken from the ARM port:  \n(define_int_iterator QABSNEG [UNSPEC_VQABS UNSPEC_VQNEG])  \n(define_int_attr absneg [(UNSPEC_VQABS \"abs\") (UNSPEC_VQNEG \"neg\")])  \n(define_insn \"neon_vq<absneg><mode>\"  \n[(set (match_operand:VDQIW 0 \"s_register_operand\" \"=w\")  \n(unspec:VDQIW [(match_operand:VDQIW 1 \"s_register_operand\" \"w\")  \n(match_operand:SI 2 \"immediate_operand\" \"i\")]  \nQABSNEG))]  \n\"TARGET_NEON\"  \n\"vq<absneg>.<V_s_elem>\\t%<V_reg>0, %<V_reg>1\"  \n[(set_attr \"type\" \"neon_vqneg_vqabs\")]  \n)  \nThis is equivalent to:  \n(define_insn \"neon_vqabs<mode>\"  \n[(set (match_operand:VDQIW 0 \"s_register_operand\" \"=w\")  \n(unspec:VDQIW [(match_operand:VDQIW 1 \"s_register_operand\" \"w\")  \n(match_operand:SI 2 \"immediate_operand\" \"i\")]  \nUNSPEC_VQABS))]  \n\"TARGET_NEON\"  \n\"vqabs.<V_s_elem>\\t%<V_reg>0, %<V_reg>1\"  \n[(set_attr \"type\" \"neon_vqneg_vqabs\")]  \n)  \n(define_insn \"neon_vqneg<mode>\"  \n[(set (match_operand:VDQIW 0 \"s_register_operand\" \"=w\")  \n(unspec:VDQIW [(match_operand:VDQIW 1 \"s_register_operand\" \"w\")  \n(match_operand:SI 2 \"immediate_operand\" \"i\")]  \nUNSPEC_VQNEG))]  \n\"TARGET_NEON\"  \n\"vqneg.<V_s_elem>\\t%<V_reg>0, %<V_reg>1\"  \n[(set_attr \"type\" \"neon_vqneg_vqabs\")]  \n)",
